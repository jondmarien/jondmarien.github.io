# Definition
The most commonly encountered browser-side prevention mechanism is namely frame busting scripts. However, it is often straightforward for an attacker to circumvent these protections. Consequently, server driven protocols have been devised that constrain browser `iframe` usage and mitigate against clickjacking.

Clickjacking is a browser-side behavior and its success or otherwise depends upon browser functionality and conformity to prevailing web standards and best practice. 

Server-side protection against clickjacking is provided by defining and communicating constraints over the use of components such as `iframe`s. 

However, implementation of protection depends upon browser compliance and enforcement of these constraints. Two mechanisms for server-side clickjacking protection are `X-Frame-Options` and `Content Security Policy`.

## X-Frame-Options

`X-Frame-Options` was originally introduced as an unofficial response header in Internet Explorer 8 and it was rapidly adopted within other browsers. The header provides the website owner with control over the use of `iframe`s or objects so that inclusion of a web page within a frame can be prohibited with the deny directive:

```
X-Frame-Options: deny
```

Alternatively, framing can be restricted to the same origin as the website using the `sameorigin` directive

```
X-Frame-Options: sameorigin
```

or to a named website using the allow-from directive:

```
X-Frame-Options: allow-from https://normal-website.com
```

`X-Frame-Options` is not implemented consistently across browsers (the `allow-from` directive is not supported in Chrome version 76 or Safari 12 for example). 

However, when properly applied in conjunction with Content Security Policy as part of a multi-layer defense strategy it can provide effective protection against clickjacking attacks.

## Content Security Policy (CSP)

Content Security Policy (CSP) is a detection and prevention mechanism that provides mitigation against attacks such as XSS and clickjacking. CSP is usually implemented in the web server as a return header of the form:

```
Content-Security-Policy: policy
```

Where `policy` is a string of policy directives separated by semicolons. The CSP provides the client browser with information about permitted sources of web resources that the browser can apply to the detection and interception of malicious behaviors.

The recommended clickjacking protection is to incorporate the frame-ancestors directive in the application's Content Security Policy. 

The `frame-ancestors 'none'` directive is similar in behavior to the `X-Frame-Options deny` directive. The `frame-ancestors 'self'` directive is broadly equivalent to the `X-Frame-Options sameorigin` directive. The following CSP whitelists frames to the same domain only:

```
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self';
```

Alternatively, framing can be restricted to named sites:

```
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors normal-website.com;
```

To be effective against clickjacking and XSS, CSPs need careful development, implementation and testing and should be used as part of a multi-layer defense strategy.
